      Set in a fictional recreation of the American Old West in 1899, Red Dead Redemption 2 focuses on the life of
      Arthur Morgan and his position in the notorious Van der Linde gang. The game follows the gang's decline as
      they
      are pursued by lawmen, fellow gangs and Pinkerton agents. The narrative revolves around the characters of
      Dutch
      van der Linde, John Marston (both of whom appeared in Red Dead Redemption) and Micah Bell in addition to
      Morgan.

      Red Dead Redemption 2 is set in an open world consisting of five American regions, which the player can
      explore as
      they proceed with the
      story, and can be played through both third-person and first-person view. As Arthur Morgan, players can
      interact
      with the game world in
      several ways, including story missions, side quests, challenges, randomized events, and hunting. An Honor
      system,
      returning from the previous
      game, changes accordingly to the player's actions towards non-player characters.
